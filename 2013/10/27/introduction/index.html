    <p>Over the past few months Ive begun to try and consolidate all my old
<a href="http://puredata.info/">Pure data</a>, <a href="http://cycling74.com/">Max/MSP</a> patches
and bits of code that I wrote related to making noises.</p>
<p>Ive decided to start this blog (and copy over a couple of posts from my old
one) to document some of these patches and scripts as I begin to move them into
a git repository, partly for myself but also for anyone who may be interested
in using or adapting them.</p>
<p>The main themes that I think will come up will be, granular synthesis,
concatenative synthesis, audio analysis, audio visualisation and various
generative algorithms.</p>
<p>The goals for most of these experiments was simply curiosity, wanting to create
weird noises and rhythms that I could then sample to create a piece of
electronic music. Other bits were attempts to try and reverse engineer things I
thought were interesting.</p>
<p>All the code and patches will be hosted in
<a href="https://github.com/davebrent/dbp">this repository</a> on github.</p>
