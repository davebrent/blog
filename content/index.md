<p>
Hi, my name is Dave Poulter. I am a full stack web developer with 6+ years of
professional experience building applications, services and websites for
agencies and startups in London. I am now based remotely in Europe, as a
contractor.
</p>

<p>
I am especially interested in geographic information systems, cartography and
all things maps. My preferred languages are Python and JavaScript but I like to
use the right tool for the job! I am fond of Python web frameworks, SQL
databases and automated testing.
</p>

<p>
In my spare time I also like to tinker with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davebrent/suze">computer graphics</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davebrent/jez">noise</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davebrent/">@davebrent</a> on
Github and can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://uk.yunojuno.com/p/dave-poulter">YunoJuno</a>.
